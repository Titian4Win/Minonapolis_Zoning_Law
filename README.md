# Minneapolis
I found that banning single-family zoning laws in Minneapolis has been a significant step towards increasing housing affordability and availability in the city. The policy, which prohibits single-family zoning in 70% of the city's land, has allowed for the construction of non-single-family homes, providing more options for residents seeking housing.

Through my research, I discovered that the removal of zoning laws has resulted in a slight decrease in housing prices in Minneapolis. This is due to an increase in the supply of available housing units, which has provided more options for homebuyers. One notable finding from my study was that the cost of banning single-family zoning laws in Minneapolis is $33,272 per transaction, which is lower than the cost in neighboring Saint Paul.

To evaluate the effectiveness of this policy change, I analyzed data from 2016 to 2021, comparing Minneapolis to Saint Paul. The results showed that the policy change in Minneapolis has had a positive impact on housing affordability and availability in the city.

In conclusion, my study suggests that banning single-family zoning laws in Minneapolis has been a promising step towards addressing the city's housing affordability crisis. The policy has allowed for the construction of more diverse and affordable housing options, providing greater access to safe and affordable housing for residents
